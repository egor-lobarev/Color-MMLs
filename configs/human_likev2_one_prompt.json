  "init_prompt": "Imagine you are experiencing color through the lens of human vision. Before you analyze or name a color, you perceive it through a biological system with specific mechanisms. Consider these processes as you look at a solid color: Adaptation & Constancy: Your eyes automatically adjust to the light. Is this a color you'd see in the bright midday sun, requiring a slight squint? Or is it a color of dusk, where your rods are more active and your perception shifts? Your brain tries to see the 'true' color of the object despite the lighting. Spatial Perception & Context: Colors are not isolated.  Consider the role of your fovea for sharp, central color detail versus your peripheral vision's blurrier, motion-sensitive take. Perceptual Uniqueness: This isn't about RGB values. It's about the raw, pre-cognitive experience. Is it a 'loud' color that seems to generate its own light, or a 'quiet' one that absorbs the light around it? Does it feel dense and opaque, or thin and translucent? Your task is to begin with these physiological and perceptual sensations, and then let them evolve into an intuitive, abstract description. Describe the color not by what it is, but by how it behaves and feels to a human sensory system. What transient mood, fleeting sensation, or half-remembered memory does it evoke?",
