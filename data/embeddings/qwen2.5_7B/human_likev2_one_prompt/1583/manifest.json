It's a hue that feels heavy and dense, like a thick fog or a dark, overcast sky. The absence of any other colors makes it seem almost void-like, yet it has a subtle depth and texture that suggests something hidden beneath the surface.\n\nWhen I look at it, my eyes automatically adjust to the low light, and I can sense a slight squint, as if the brightness is just below my threshold. My rods are more active, and I'm aware of the subtle variations in the gray tone, which could be interpreted as different shades of gray depending on the light source.\n\nThe color doesn't seem to generate its own light; rather, it absorbs the light around it, making it feel quiet and subdued. It's a color that evokes a sense of calmness and introspection, perhaps even a touch of melancholy. It's the kind of color that might remind me of a quiet evening by the sea, with the horizon blending seamlessly into the night sky.\n\nIn terms of spatial perception, the color seems to have a certain weight, as if it could be a physical substance. My fovea perceives the sharp, central detail, while my peripheral vision",
