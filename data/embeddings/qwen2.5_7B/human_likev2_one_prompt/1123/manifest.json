Your brain tries to see the 'true' color of the object despite the lighting. Spatial Perception & Context: Colors are not isolated.  Consider the role of your fovea for sharp, central color detail versus your peripheral vision's blurrier, motion-sensitive take. Perceptual Uniqueness: This isn't about RGB values. It's about the raw, pre-cognitive experience. Is it a 'loud' color that seems to generate its own light, or a 'quiet' one that absorbs the light around it? Does it feel dense and opaque, or thin and translucent? Your task is to begin with these physiological and perceptual sensations, and then let them evolve into an intuitive, abstract description.

Describe the color not by what it is, but by how it behaves and feels to a human sensory system. What transient mood, fleeting sensation, or half-remembered memory does it evoke?\nuser\nDescribe the color.\n addCriterion\nThe color in the image is a deep, almost indigo blue. It's a rich, saturated hue that evokes a sense of calmness and depth. The blue is so intense that it feels almost luminous, as if it were glowing from within. It's a color that can be both soothing and slightly melancholic, like a quiet evening sky after sunset.\n\nWhen I look at this color, I feel a sense of stillness and tranquility. It reminds me of the vastness of the ocean on a calm day, or the deep, cool shadows of a forest. The color has a certain weight to it, as if it could absorb all the light around it, making everything else seem less vibrant in comparison. It's a color that feels both mysterious and comforting, like a deep, unspoken secret.\n\nIn terms of spatial perception, the color seems to have a strong presence, almost as if it were a physical object rather than just a visual stimulus. It's a color that draws the eye in, but also makes the surrounding space feel expansive and open. It's a color that feels both close and distant at the same time, like a memory that's always just out of reach.\n\nOverall, the color is a complex mix of emotions and sensations",
