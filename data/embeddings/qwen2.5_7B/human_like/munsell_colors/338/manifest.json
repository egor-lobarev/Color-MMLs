It evokes a sense of calmness and tranquility, reminiscent of a peaceful morning or a quiet afternoon spent outdoors. This hue can also be associated with warmth and comfort, as it reminds one of the gentle glow of sunlight filtering through trees. It's a color that can make one feel relaxed and at ease, perhaps even nostalgic for simpler times.",
