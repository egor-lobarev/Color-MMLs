White is often associated with purity, cleanliness, and new beginnings. It can evoke feelings of peace and calmness, as well as a sense of clarity and simplicity. In art and design, white is frequently used to create a sense of space and light, making it a versatile color that can enhance the visual impact of other colors when used in contrast.",
